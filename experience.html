            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p><b class="fancy">We all have to begin somewhere. </b> When I started my very first job at 15 years old, I never would have guessed I would have been with the company for seven years. Heck, even when I turned 16 I thought about trying to get a "cooler" job - but I never pursued anything that could resemble being "cooler." As the years went on, I realized that maybe that was ok. I kept growing in the positions I held, which was what I really had going for myself since I was still in high school. <br><hr>
            After graduation, I thought about the extra time I had, so I picked up another job. At Finish Line, the experiences I had with my co-workers were quite memorable. Between the coworkers and the skills I gained, having this second job was well worth it. I was able to hone in and connect with the customers more compared to Papa Murphy's. After leaving this position, I was able to take that ability to make those connections at Papa Murphy's. We had our regulars, but I soon realized I was making those connections and becoming well-liked amongst our customers. I strived to get great surveys and feedback  from customers. <br><hr>
            A good friend of mine, who had recently finished her intership and graduated, had recommended an open position to me at the same company she did her internship through and got hired at. When starting at Bethany Retirement Living, I considered this to my "foot in the door" kind of moment to be able to get into medical coding. After doing a couple part time semesters online in a Health Information Technology and Coding program, I had decided to pause my education; only to decide I wanted to buy a house instead (the housing market was crazy, but interest rates were low! There was no way I wanted to pass that up). Fast forward to 2022, I finally took the dive into learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As one might say from this point: the rest has been history.
